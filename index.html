          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Our journey began via social media (YouTube and Facebook) by
            delivering short video blogs explaining science and engineering
            concepts of varying difficulty levels using their practical real
            world applications in the name of a channel, ‘Light Up'. People who
            started following our videos began to understand these concepts
            better and started to relate them with real-world applications
            around them. Over the past two years, we have enabled clear
            understanding on selected science concepts for over1+ million people
            through social media. At this juncture, we realized the need to take
            this understanding further for the development of the masses in
            society. Our digital selves went through a ‘Big Bang’ to come to the
            real world and we evolved with the concept of a science fair from
            LMES called ‘Big Bang’. Other initiatives like e-content
            development, educational TV programs have also become a part of
            Light Up. In short, our motto is to promote application based
            learning which facilitates the learner to understand instead of
            promoting rote learning. LightUp strives hard to create awareness
            about the ease of science, by bringing an attitudinal change towards
            science. Be a part of Light Up for a better education system.
